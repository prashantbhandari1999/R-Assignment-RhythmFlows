## Tasks performed
1. The number of null observations.
2. The total number of observations
3. Maximum of the values for each column
4. Minimum of the values for each column.
5. Mean of the values for each column.
6. The standard deviation of the values for each column.
7. The number of unique values in each column.[Do not use the dataset describe function. Manually calculate the values using standard R functions]
8. Plot a pairwise correlation heatmap for all the attributes of the dataset. 
9. Using a Regression algorithm, forecast the MEDV value based on the remaining 13 attributes.Evaluate your Regression model using the following metrics:
    + Mean Square Error (MSE)
    + Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    + Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
